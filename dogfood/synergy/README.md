# Synergy

Synergy (or `sy`) is a nix flake framework.

Its goal is to provide a set of rules (or constraints) that allow code maintainers to code in an organized way, ideally more maintainable than without using it.

You don't have to worry about importing your code, or about systems. Create a file in the right folder, access the same set of parameters from everywhere, have that code transformed to reflect the right flake output.
